# tictactoe
A little tictactoe game made with JS and ChatGPT

This was a tryout to solve coding problems with ChatGPT 3.5. 
I createt some functions and the SVGs with ChatGPT and worte some smaller functions by myself.

I wanted so see how fast someone with low coding skills in JS can come and create a Tic-Tac-Toe game with the help of AI.

Feel free to scroll trough my code.
